We will also compare and contrast the leading JavaScript and Mobile Frameworks, and you will use the new Topcoat CSS toolkit as the basis for your application UI."

We'll also look at remote mobile debugging using native tools and also look at the alternative tools where native support isn't available.\n\nThe workshop will mostly be about the foundation of debugging techniques, which apply way beyond just a single browser's debugger tool, but will raise your expectation of all web debugging environments."
