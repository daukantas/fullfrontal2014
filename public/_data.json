This workshop is dedicated to learning the native developer tools baked in to the browser to make our life a little more bearable.",
      "extendedDescription": "We will look at features of Chrome DevTools, what's available in Firefox debugging suite. We'll also look at remote mobile debugging using native tools and also look at the alternative tools where native support isn't available.\n\nThe workshop will mostly be about the foundation of debugging techniques, which apply way beyond just a single browser's debugger tool, but will raise your expectation of all web debugging environments."
