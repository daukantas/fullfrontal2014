  <p>Please also hashtag all the things with <strong>#ffconf!</strong></p>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<p>How to get there: <a href="http://ffconf.org/directions">http://ffconf.org/directions</a></p>
<p>The conference is being held at the historic Duke of York&#39;s Picturehouse in Brighton. It is centrally located on Preston Circus, less than 15 minutes walk from Brighton train station. Trains run regularly from Gatwick Airport, London Bridge and London Victoria stations. We recommend using <a href="http://www.traintimes.org.uk">http://www.traintimes.org.uk</a> for up to date timetables. Hotel recommendations can be found on our website: <a href="http://2014.ffconf.org/#locations">http://2014.ffconf.org/#locations</a></p>
<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>
<p>Registration opens at 9am and the conference starts at 9:40am sharp! There are no tickets for the conference, but you must bring a form of identification (bank card, driving licence etc) to pick up your delegate programme which also acts as your pass. Please keep your pass with you at all times as you will need it to get back into the conference.</p>
<p>Note that by attending any of our events - workshops &amp; conference, you are agreeing to our code of conduct: <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com">http://confcodeofconduct.com</a> - <em>tl;dr: Be excellent with each other.</em></p>
<h2 id="technology">Technology</h2>
<p>If you plan to bring a laptop, make sure it&#39;s fully charged for the day, as we only have a few charging stations in the venue.</p>
<p>There is no wifi. I mean, it's a cinema, why would it have the internets! Network coverage however is very good, so you can tether your mobile phone or bring your own mifi or dongle, etc.</p>
<p>In fact, it&#39;s even been known that some people go classic old school and use a pen and paper! See: <a href="http://flic.kr/p/7hmEGJ">http://flic.kr/p/7hmEGJ</a> :)</p>
<h2 id="refreshments">Refreshments</h2>
<p>Tea, Coffee and Danishes will be available from 9am in the upstairs bar and the ground floor. Further refreshments will be available from the same locations at the mid morning and mid afternoon breaks. Please note lunch is not included but we have a few recommendations here: <a href="http://ffconf.org/food">http://ffconf.org/food</a></p>

You will also need to leave by 10pm as the venue doesn&#39;t have a license for under 18s beyond this time. All important, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be super awesome and play nice.</p>
